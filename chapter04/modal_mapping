-- [0] A few simple mappings --

note: remember the <c-<key>> form of mappings allow you to map to a control modifier
key press, e.g. {lhs}=<c-d> maps the {rhs} to the key press Control+d.

<esc> represents the escape key in the mapping key sequences. It can be used to switch
modes in a mapping (since escape exits the current mode going back to normal mode), e.g.

:imap <c-d> <esc>ddi

=> maps Control+d in insert mode to the sequence which (1) escapes to normal mode, (2) deletes
the current line under the cursor, (3) returns to insert mode.

-- [1] The excersize solutions --

note: these excersizes can have multiple solutions as in vim there is more than one way to skin
a cat.

[i] Uppercase word in insert mode.

{lhs}=<c-u> {rhs}=<esc>gUiwi     => converts the current word to uppercase when in insert mode.

      or

{lhs}=<c-u> {rhs}=<esc>viwUi

The above mapping does however result in the cursor being at the start of the word being upper-
cased, can move the cursor to the end to continue typing in insert mode with the mapping,

{lhs}=<c-u> {rhs}=<esc>viwUea

note: don't forget to map it with :imap not :map so the mapping applies to insert mode not 
normal mode (I made that mistake when testing).

[ii] Uppercase word in normal mode.

{lhs}=<c-u> {rhs}=gUiw
