-- [0] The 'Leader' key in mappings --

To expand the number of keys which can be mapped to custom sequences and to avoid
having to overwrite the default mappings of keys you can use a leader key in which
the leader key sort-of acts like a switch into a different mode.

You could introduce your own leader key by simply prefixing all your custome mappings
with the same key, e.g.

:map -d dd
:map -u guiw
:map -U gUiw

and so on.

But vim directly supports this concept allowing you to define a leader key with the
command:

:let mapleader="<your_key>"

e.g.

:let mapleader="-"

you can then use the tag <leader> in your sequence mappings, e.g.

:map <leader>d dd
:map <leader>u guiw
:map <leader>U gUiw

and so on.

-- [1] The 'Local Leader' key in mappings --

The local leader is a leader key for specific types of files, allowing you to have custom
(different) leader keys for different file types, e.g. C source, python source etc.

reminder: I should use the *noremap versions of the map command.
